2.0.1 (2023-11-02)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Restrict extra fields in ``MemoryHWMStore`` and allow in ``BaseModel`` as classes ``Table``, ``Process`` are inherited from ``BaseModel`` (as we keep compatibility) (:github:pull:`38`)
- Return ``qualified_name`` to new ``etl_entities.hwm.HWM`` class as old hwm classes use this attribute to get value from ``MemoryHWMStore`` (:github:pull:`39`)
