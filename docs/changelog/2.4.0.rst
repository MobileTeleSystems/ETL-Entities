2.4.0 (2024-11-12)
==================

Breaking Changes
----------------

- Make ``KeyValueIntHWM`` keys strictly integers. Previously string values could be used. (:github:pull:`103`)
- ``KeyValueHWM`` now has 2 required generic arguments - ``KeyValueHWMKeyType`` and ``KeyValueHWMValueType``.
  This allows creating own ``key -> value`` HWM types with arbitrary ``key`` type (previously it was ``Any``). (:github:pull:`103`)
